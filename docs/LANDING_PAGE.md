## The Problem

### Section Headline
**Budgeting shouldn't feel like homework.**

Most money apps are spreadsheets with better fonts. Cold numbers. Confusing charts. Zero emotional connection.

You know you *should* track your spending. But every time you open Mint or YNAB, you feel... nothing. Or worse — anxiety.

**What if managing money actually felt good?**

## The Solution

Peach is your 1960s housewife bestie who actually cares about your finances. She'll celebrate your wins, gently scold your splurges, and keep you accountable — all with vintage charm.

**Features:**

#### 💬 Actually Talk to Your Budget
Chat with Peach like a friend. "How am I doing this month?" "I just spent $80 on dinner." She responds in character, with period-appropriate wisdom and the occasional side-eye.

#### 🍪 Cookie Jar Savings
Watch your savings grow in a literal cookie jar. Set goals for vacation, emergencies, or that thing you've been eyeing. Peach cheers you on.

#### ✉️ The Envelope System (Digitized)
Grandma's budgeting method, beautifully reimagined. Drag cash into categories. See exactly what's left. No math required.

#### 📰 The Sunday Paper
Every week, Peach delivers your financial "newspaper" — spending trends, achievements, and gentle nudges. "Shoe spending up 40%? Oh dear."
